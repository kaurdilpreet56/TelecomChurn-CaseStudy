# TelecomChurn-CaseStudy
Business Objective: To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

In this project, I have analyzed customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, built predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identified the main indicators of churn.
I have used Data imbalance techniques and PCA in this case study for feature selection.

Finally, recommended strategies to manage customer churn based on my observations.
